# HelperLibrary

HelperLibrary is a small library for:

- diffrent types of `hashing`
- creation and en-/decryption with `RSA-Key-Pairs`
- reading and writing `.ini-Files`
- open connection to `MySQL-Servers` and `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE` data
- creating easily a `Client-Server` application (with SSL!)
